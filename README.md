# multilooper
Multitrack live looping system

This software was created for the live looping rig I used onstage and 
in the studio with Ghost Ghost from 2011 - 2013. 


Multilooper relies on Ableton Live 8's Looper instrument, and the Max 
For Live programming environment. It might work with later versions 
of Ableton and Max For Live, but YMMV. The software and hardware is 
described more fully at:
